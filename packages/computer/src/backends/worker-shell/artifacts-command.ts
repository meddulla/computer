// `artifacts` custom command for the worker-backend's shell isolate.
//
// The shell runs in a Dynamic Worker with no network access of its
// own (the loader sets `globalOutbound: null` — see worker.ts).
// Every `artifacts` invocation here forwards to a host-side
// artifacts client's `cli(...)`, where the real Artifacts binding
// lives. The host call does the network work; the shell only needs
// to reach it over the loopback.
//
// This is the artifacts analogue of `defineGitCommand`. The `git`
// command reaches the workspace stub; `artifacts` reaches an
// optional host method that owns the consumer-supplied Artifacts
// binding.
//
// Keeping this file clean is deliberate. Argv parsing and every
// behavioral choice live in `artifacts/cli.ts`, and the bridge to the
// client in `../workspace-commands.ts`, shared with the Kitebuild
// backend; this file only adapts the just-bash `Command` signature.
